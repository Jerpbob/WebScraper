# WebScraper
A webscraper for a manga site. It currently just takes data from mangakakalot and prints out the data in a json format
___
## Current plan:
Make a simple application that scrapes data from a certain manga site and then put that data into a database.
Once satisfactory, implement a backend that serves this data based on the url requests (POST,GET,PUT,DELETE) by
separating certain data with the user favorites and user history
___
## Future plans:
Obviously implement a frontend w/ a (hopefully) clean UI and a search bar, with a history section, user's favorites,
and a library of saved manga. Ultimately, creating a section that showcases any updated chapters (which is why I started
this project)
